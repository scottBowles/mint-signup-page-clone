This is a clone of Mint's signup page, found here: https://accounts.intuit.com/signup.html?offering_id=Intuit.ifs.mint&namespace_id=50000026&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmint.intuit.com%2Foverview.event%3Ftask%3DS

This was done as a project from The Odin's Project's curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/html-forms)

The page is not meant to have any functionality. It was done as html/css practice.

I had to find a font similar to the font used by Mint, so it isn't perfect. Otherwise I'm pretty happy though.

I also haven't added in the site's logo animation. Maybe I'll come back and add it later. For now, it isn't my top priority.
